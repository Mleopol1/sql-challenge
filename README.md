# SQL Challenge

## Project Overview

My task was to research the employee database of a fictitious company from the 1980s and 1990s, which consisted of six different CSV files. I designed tables to hold the data, imported the CSV files into a SQL database, and performed data analysis.

### Data Modeling

First, I created an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to sketch out the table structure. I used [QuickDBD](https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/ "QuickDBD") for this step, a free online tool for creating ERDs. A PNG of the diagram can be found in the EmployeeSQL folder of this repository. 

### Data Engineering

Then, I created table schemas for each CSV file based on the ERD from the previous step and imported the data into the SQL database. The table schemas can be found in the table_schemata.sql file in the EmployeeSQL folder.

### Data Analysis

Finally, I analyzed the data by performing several SQL queries to answer questions about the employees, including their names, departments, salaries, and other details. The questions and queries can be found in the queries.sql file in the EmployeeSQL folder.
